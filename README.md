This presentation analyzes the user experience (UX) of FlexTrade's online shopping app, aiming to boost sales and customer satisfaction.  While FlexTrade is a recognized player in the online retail space, their app faces challenges despite its user-friendly design.  Specifically, the presentation identifies key problem areas: a high bounce rate, significant cart abandonment, and a low average order value, all contributing to a need to stand out in a competitive market.

The core objective of this project is to pinpoint UX issues within the app through user behavior analysis and feedback.  The goal is to optimize the checkout process for speed and ease of use, implement personalized product recommendations to increase user engagement, and ultimately drive higher spending.

The analysis managed by a skilled data analyst through insightful data analysis, reveals significant fluctuations in key metrics across different months, highlighting the need to understand the underlying causes of these variations.  By identifying factors contributing to both high and low performance periods, FlexTrade can better predict and manage its business cycles.  A crucial recommendation focuses on improving the checkout process, a known pain point for users, by streamlining it and addressing technical issues like app crashes, cart bugs, and search functionality problems.  These improvements aim to reduce user frustration and increase conversion rates.  Finally, the presentation suggests leveraging FlexTrade's strengths—like user-friendliness, competitive pricing, product selection, and customer service—in their marketing strategies to attract and retain more customers.
